# Studying Moral-based Differences in the Framing of Political Tweets

This repository contains the code for the paper `Studying Moral-based Differences in the Framing of Political Tweets`. ([Preprint is available here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.11853))

The paper deals with moral framing using five moral foundations: (a) care, (b) fairness, (c) loyalty, (d) authority, and (e) sanctity.  
The experiments are conducted in Austrian and US based Twitter data.  

TLDR: we find that different moral values are associated with different political messages spread by US & Austrian politicians via Twitter.
